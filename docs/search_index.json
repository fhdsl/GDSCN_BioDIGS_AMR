In this module, students will investigate whether metagenomic samples from the BioDIGS project contain antimicrobial resistance genes. They will run analyses using ABRicate as implemented on Galaxy. Visit the BioDIGS (BioDiversity and Informatics for Genomics Scholars) website here for more information about this collaborative, distributed research project, including how you can get involved! The GDSCN (Genomics Data Science Community Network) is a consortium of educators who aim to create a world where researchers, educators, and students from diverse backgrounds are able to fully participate in genomic data science research. You can find more information about its mission and initiatives here. 0.1 Skills Level The activities in this guide are written for undergraduate students and beginning graduate students. Genetics Beginner: some genetics knowledge needed Programming skills Novice: no programming experience needed 0.2 Platform The activities in this guide are demonstrated on NHGRI’s AnVIL cloud computing platform. AnVIL is the preferred computing platform for the GDSCN. However, all of these activities can be done using your personal installation of R or using the online Galaxy portal. Please check out our full collection of AnVIL and related resources: https://hutchdatascience.org/AnVIL_Collection/ 0.3 Data The data generated by the BioDIGS project is available through the BioDIGS website, as well as through an AnVIL workspace. Data about the soil itself as well as soil metal content was generated by the Delaware Soil Testing Program at the University of Delaware. Sequences were generated by the Johns Hopkins University Genetic Resources Core Facility and by PacBio. "],["background.html", "Chapter 1 Background 1.1 What is genomics? 1.2 What is data science? 1.3 What is cloud computing? 1.4 Why soil microbes? 1.5 Heavy metals and human health", " Chapter 1 Background One critical aspect of an undergraduate STEM education is hands-on research. Undergraduate research experiences enhance what students learn in the classroom as well as increase a student’s interest in pursuing STEM careers (Russell, Hancock, and McCullough 2007). It can also lead to improved scientific reasoning and increased academic performance overall (Buffalari et al. 2020). However, many students at underresourced institutions like community colleges, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), tribal colleges and universities, and Hispanic-serving institutions have limited access to research opportunities compared to their cohorts at larger four-year colleges and R1 institutions. These students are also more likely to belong to groups that are already under-represented in STEM disciplines, particularly genomics and data science (Canner et al. 2017; GDSCN 2022). The BioDIGS Project aims to be at the intersection of genomics, data science, cloud computing, and education. 1.1 What is genomics? Genomics broadly refers to the study of genomes, which are an organism’s complete set of DNA. This includes both genes and non-coding regions of DNA. Traditional genomics involves sequencing and analyzing the genome of individual species. Metagenomics expands genomics to look at the collective genomes of entire communities of organisms in an environmental sample, like soil. It allows researchers to study not just the genes of culturable or isolated organisms, but the entirety of genetic material present in a given environment. By using genomic techniques to survey the soil microbes, we can identify everything in the soil, including microbes that no one has identified before. We are doing both traditional genomics and metagenomics as part of BioDIGS. 1.2 What is data science? Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data. It includes collecting, cleaning, and combining data from multiple databases, exploring data and developing statistical and machine learning models to identify patterns in complex datasets, and creating tools to efficiently store, process, and access large amounts of data. 1.3 What is cloud computing? Cloud computing just means using the internet to get access to powerful computer resources like storage, servers, databases, networking tools, and specialized software programs. Instead of having to buy and maintain their own powerful computers, storage servers, and other systems, users can pay to use them through an internet connection as needed. Users only pay for what they need, when they actually use it, and professionals update and maintain the systems in large data centers. It is a particularly useful tool for researchers and students at smaller institutions with limited computational services, especially when working with complex databases. The genome assembly and analyses for BioDIGS have been done using the NHGRI AnVIL cloud computing platform, as well as Galaxy. 1.4 Why soil microbes? It can be challenging to include undergraduates in human genomic and health research, especially in a classroom context. Both human genetic data and human health data are protected data, which limits the sort of information students can access without undergoing specialized ethics training. However, the same sorts of data cleaning and analysis methods used for human genomic data are also used for microbial genomic data, which does not have the same sort of legal protections as human genetic data. This makes it ideal for training undergraduate students at the beginning of their careers and can be used to prepare students for future research in human genomics and health (Jurkowski, Reid, and Labov 2017). Additionally, the microbes in the soil can have big impacts on our health (Brevik and Burgess 2014). 1.5 Heavy metals and human health Human activities that change the landscape can also change what sorts of inorganic and abiotic compounds we find in the soil, particularly increasing the amount of heavy metals (Yan et al. 2020). When cars drive on roads, compounds from the exhaust, oil, and other fluids might settle onto the roads and be washed into the soil. When we put salt on roads, parking lots, and sidewalks, the salts themselves will eventually be washed away and enter the ecosystem through both water and soil. Chemicals from factories and other businesses also leech into our environment. Previous research has demonstrated that in areas with more human activity, like cities, soils include greater concentrations of heavy metals than found in rural areas with limited human populations (Khan et al. 2023; Wang, Birch, and Liu 2022). Increased heavy metal concentrations also disproportionately affect lower-income and predominantly minority areas (Jones et al. 2022). Research suggests that increased heavy metal concentration in soils has major impacts on the soil microbial community. In particular, increased heavy metal concentration is associated with an increase in soil bacteria that have antibiotic resistance markers (Gorovtsov, Sazykin, and Sazykina 2018; Nguyen et al. 2019; Sun, Xu, and Fan 2021).

These sections guide you through that process. 5.1 Create Google Billing Account Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Make sure to use the same Google account ID you use to log into Terra. If you are a first time user, don’t forget to claim your free credits! If you haven’t been to the console before, once you accept the Terms of Service you will be greeted with an invitation to “Try for Free.” Follow the instructions to sign up for a Billing Account and get your credits. Choose “Individual Account”. This “billing account” is just for managing billing, so you don’t need to be able to add your team members. You will need to give either a credit card or bank account for security. Don’t worry! You won’t be billed until you explicitly turn on automatic billing. You can view and edit your new Billing Account, by selecting “Billing” from the left-hand menu, or going directly to the billing console console.cloud.google.com/billing Clicking on the Billing Account name will allow you to manage the account, including accessing reports, setting alerts, and managing payments and billing. At any point, you can create additional Billing Accounts using the Create Account button. We generally recommend creating a new Billing Account for each funding source. 5.2 Add Terra to Google Billing Account This gives Terra permission to create projects and send charges to the Google Billing Account, and must be done by an administrator of the Google Billing Account. Terra needs to be added as a “Billing Account User”: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add Terra to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter terra-billing@terra.bio in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose “Billing Account User”. Click “SAVE”. 5.3 Add Members to Google Billing Account Anyone you wish to add to the Billing Account will need their own Google ID. To add a member to a Billing Project: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using your Google ID. Navigate to Billing You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account rather than a list of your Billing Accounts, you can get back to the list by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Check the box next to the Billing Account you wish to add a member to, click “ADD MEMBER”. Enter their Google ID in the text box. In the drop-down menu, mouse over Billing, then choose the appropriate role. Click “SAVE”. 5.4 Set Alerts for Google Billing Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on Billing. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account you want to set alerts for. In the left-hand menu, click “Budgets &amp; alerts”. Click the “Create Budget” tab. Enter a name for your budget, and then choose which projects you want to monitor. Then click “Next”. For Budget Type, select “Specified amount”. Enter the total budget amount for the month (you will set alerts at different thresholds in the next step). Click “Next” (do not click “Finish”). Enter the threshold amounts where you want to receive an alert. We recommend starting with 50% and 90%. You can set other alerts if you prefer. Check the box for “Email alerts to billing admins and users”, then click “Finish”. Now you (as the owner and admin), along with anyone you added with admin or user privileges (e.g. lab managers) will receive alerts when your lab members reach the specified spending thresholds. These emails will be sent to the Gmail accounts associated with the Billing Account. You can edit your budgets at any time by going to Billing &gt; Budgets &amp; alerts, and clicking on the name of the budget you want to edit. 5.5 View Spend for Google Billing You can always check your current spend through the Google Billing console, but remember There is a reporting delay (~1 day), so you cannot immediately see what an analysis cost Costs are reported at the level of Workspaces, so if there are multiple people using a Workspace, you will not be able to determine which of them was responsible for the charges. The Google Billing console displays information by Billing Account. To view spending: Log in to the Google Cloud Platform console using the Google ID associated with your Google Cloud projects. Open the dropdown menu on the top left and click on Billing. You may be automatically directed to view a specific Billing Account. If you see information about a single account (and it’s not the one you’re interested in), you can get back to the list of all your Billing Accounts by clicking “Manage Billing Accounts” from the drop-down menu. Click on the name of the Billing Account for the project you want to view. Look at the top of the Overview tab to see your month-to-date spending. Scroll further down the Overview tab to show your top projects. Click on the Reports tab to see more detailed information about each of your projects. This is probably the most useful tab for exploring costs of individual projects over time. Click on the Cost table tab to obtain a convenient table of spending per project. 5.6 Create Terra Billing Project Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. If this is your first time logging in to Terra, you will need to accept the Terms of Service. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. You can also navigate there directly with this link: https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing On the Billing page, click the “+ CREATE” button to create a new Billing Project. Select GCP Billing Project (Google’s Platform). If prompted, select the Google account to use and give Terra permission to manage Google Cloud Platform billing accounts. Enter a unique name for your Terra Billing Project and select the appropriate Google Billing Account. The name of the Terra Billing Project must: Only contain lowercase letters, numbers and hyphens Start with a lowercase letter Not end with a hyphen Be between 6 and 30 characters Select the Google Billing Account to use. All activities conducted under your new Terra Billing Project will charge to this Google Billing Account. If prompted, give Terra permission to manage Google Cloud Platform billing accounts. Click “Create”. Your new Billing Project should now show up in the list of Billing Projects Owned by You. You can add additional members or can modify or deactivate the Billing Project at any time by clicking on its name in this list. The page doesn’t always update as soon as the Billing Project is created. If it’s been a couple of minutes and you don’t see a change, try refreshing the page. 5.7 Add Member to Terra Billing Project Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. You can also navigate there directly with this link: https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “Owned by You” and find the Billing Project. If you do not see the Billing Project in this list, then you are not an Owner and do not have permission to add members. Click on the name of the Billing Project. Click on the “Members” tab to view and manage members. Then click the “Add User” button. Enter the email address of the user or group you’d like to add the the Billing Project. If adding an individual, make sure to enter the account that they use to access AnVIL. If adding a Terra Group, use the Group email address, which can be found on the Terra Group management page. If this user or group will need to add and remove other users of the Billing Project, check the Owner box. Otherwise leave it unchecked. It’s often a good idea to have at least one other Owner of a Billing Project in order to avoid getting locked out, in case the original owner leaves or loses access to their account. Click “ADD USER”. You should now see the user or group listed in the Billing Project members, along with the appropriate role. They should now be able to use the Billing Project to fund work on AnVIL. If you need to remove members or modify their roles, you can do so at any time by clicking the teardrop button next to their name. 5.8 Disable Terra Billing Project Disabling a Billing Project makes Workspace contents inaccessible! Disabling a Billing Project disables funding to all Workspaces funded by the Billing Project. You will be unable to compute in these Workspaces, and you will lose access to any data stored in the Workspace buckets. It is sometimes possible to restore access by reactivating billing, but Google makes no promises about whether or how long the data will be recoverable. Make sure everyone with Workspaces funded by the Billing Project has saved anything they want to keep in another location before disabling the Billing Project. To disable a Terra Billing Project (i.e. remove the Google Billing Account that funds the Terra Billing Project): Launch Terra and sign in with your Google account. In the drop-down menu on the left, navigate to “Billing”. Click the triple bar in the top left corner to access the menu. Click the arrow next to your name to expand the menu, then click “Billing”. You can also navigate there directly with this link: https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “Owned by You” and find the Billing Project. If you do not see the Billing Project in this list, then you are not an Owner and do not have permission to add members. Click on the name of the Billing Project. If you don’t see information about the Billing Account, click on “View billing account” to expand the Billing Account information. You may be prompted to enter your login information again. You should see the name of the Google Billing Account that is funding this Terra Billing Project. Click on the teardrop icon next to the name of the Billing Account. Click “Remove Billing Account”. Click OK to confirm that you want to disable funding for this Billing Project. The page should now indicate that there is no linked billing account. If necessary, you can restore funding to the Billing Project and associated Workspaces by clicking the teardrop icon and selecting “Change Billing Account”. However, Google makes no promises about how long the Workspace contents will remain available after you disable funding, so it is best not to rely on them. "],["anvil-workspace.html", "Chapter 6 AnVIL Workspace 6.1 Create Google Account 6.2 Clone the Workspace", " Chapter 6 AnVIL Workspace You can access the data on AnVIL by cloning the dedicated Workspace. These sections guide you through creating an AnVIL account and accessing the Workspace. 6.1 Create Google Account If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing Terra, create one now. If you would like to create a Google account that is associated with your non-Gmail, institutional email address, follow these instructions. 6.2 Clone the Workspace Launch Terra Locate the Workspace you want to clone. If a Workspace has been shared with you ahead of time, it will appear in “MY WORKSPACES”. You can clone a Workspace that was shared with you to perform your own analyses. In the screenshot below, no Workspaces have been shared. If a Workspace hasn’t been shared with you, navigate to the “FEATURED” or “PUBLIC” Workspace tabs. Use the search box to find the Workspace you want to clone. Click the teardrop button on the far right next to the Workspace you want to clone. Click “Clone”. You can also clone the Workspace from the Workspace Dashboard instead of the search results. You will see a popup box appear. Name your Workspace and select the appropriate Terra Billing Project. All activity in the Workspace will be charged to this Billing Project (regardless of who conducted it). Remember that each Workspace should have its own Billing Project. If you are working with protected data, you can set the Authorization Domain to limit who can be added to your Workspace. Note that the Authorization Domain cannot be changed after the Workspace is created (i.e. there is no way to make this Workspace shareable with a larger audience in the future). Workspaces by default are only visible to people you specifically share them with. Authorization domains add an extra layer of enforcement over privacy, but by nature make sharing more complicated. We recommend using Authorization Domains in cases where it is extremely important and/or legally required that the data be kept private (e.g. protected patient data, industry data). For data you would merely prefer not be shared with the world, we recommend relying on standard Workspace sharing permissions rather than Authorization Domains, as Authorization Domains can make future collaborations, publications, or other sharing complicated. Click “CLONE WORKSPACE”. The new Workspace should now show up under your Workspaces.

Open your Workspace, and click on the “Environment configuration” button, a cloud icon on the righthand side of the screen. Under Galaxy, click on “Create new Environment”. Click on “Next” and “Create” to keep all settings as-is. This will take 8-10 minutes. Click on “Open Galaxy” when the environment is ready. 7.3 Navigating Galaxy Notice the three main sections. Tools - These are all of the bioinformatics tool packages available for you to use. The Main Dashboard - This contains flash messages and posts when you first open Galaxy, but when we are using data this is the main interface area. History - When you start a project you will be able to see all of the documents in the project in the history. Now be aware, this can become very busy. Also the naming that Galaxy uses is not very intuitive, so you must make sure that you label your files with something that makes sense to you. On the welcome page, there are links to tutorials. You may try these out on your own. If you want to try a new analysis this is a good place to start. 7.4 Deleting Galaxy Once you are done with your activity, you’ll need to shut down your Galaxy cloud environment. This frees up the cloud resources for others and minimizes computing cost. The following steps will delete your work, so make sure you are completely finished at this point. Otherwise, you will have to repeat your work from the previous steps. Return to AnVIL, and find the Galaxy logo that shows your cloud environment is running. Click on this logo. Next, click on “Settings”. Click on “Delete Environment”. Finally, select “Delete everything, including persistent disk”. Make sure you are done with the activity and then click “Delete”.

The AnVIL (Analysis Visualization and Informatics Lab-space) platform is specially designed for analyzing biological data, and is used by scientists doing all sorts of biological research. AnVIL in a nutshell Behind the scenes, AnVIL relies on Google Cloud Platform to provide computing infrastructure. Basically, AnVIL lets you “rent” computers through the internet. The analysis is run on the rented computer. AnVIL lets you see the results in your browser. AnVIL uses Terra to provide many computational tools useful for biological data analysis, such as RStudio, Galaxy, and Jupyter Notebooks. Terra takes care of installing these tools so you can use them right away. 8.1.1 Create Google Account First, you will need to set up a (free) Google account. A Google account usually looks like “myname@gmail.com”. Alternatively, you can enable Google for an existing non-Gmail email address using these instructions. If you do not already have a Google account that you would like to use for accessing AnVIL, create one now. 8.1.2 Log In to Terra Next, make sure you can log in to Terra – you will use Terra to perform computations on AnVIL. You can access Terra by going to anvil.terra.bio. Open Terra, and you should be prompted to sign in with your Google account. 8.1.3 Share Username Make sure your instructor has your Google account username (e.g. myname@gmail.com), so they can give you access to everything you need. Make sure there are no typos! If you have multiple Google accounts, make sure you give them the username that you will be using to log in to anvil.terra.bio. It is very important that you share the Google account you will be using to access AnVIL with with your instructor! Otherwise, the instructor cannot add you to Billing Projects or Workspaces, and you will be unable to proceed with your assignments. 8.2 Cloning the AnVIL Workspace This will not work until your instructor has given you permission to spend money to “rent” the computers that will power your analyses (by adding you to a “Billing Project”). On AnVIL, you access files and computers through Workspaces. Each Workspace functions almost like a mini code laboratory - it is a place where data can be examined, stored, and analyzed. The first thing we want to do is to copy or “clone” a Workspace to create a space for you to experiment. This will give you access to the files you will need (data, code) the computing environment you will use Tip At this point, it might make things easier to open up a new window in your browser and split your screen. That way, you can follow along with this guide on one side and execute the steps on the other.

You will: * Set up a billing project for tracking costs * Add yourself and students to the billing project to grant permission to AnVIL resources * Learn about different sources of costs in AnVIL * Estimate costs for your class * Learn about how to track costs during your class 11.1 Creating a billing project First, create the Billing Project. Billing Project names must be globally unique and cannot exceed 30 characters. We suggest the name of the Billing Project should be a combination of institution-class- (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique Billing Project. 11.2 Adding Instructors as “Owner” Next, you want to give instructors permission to use the Billing Project to compute. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made in Instructor Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in Instructor Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit permissions and administer the Billing Project as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the student Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should always use the instructor Workspace to compute. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with instructors versus students. 11.3 Adding Students as “User” Next, you will add your student Group to the Billing Project so that they can compute. To set student permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made in Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the student Group name set up in Student Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-students@firecloud.org). Keep “Can manage users (Owner)” deselected. Click “ADD USER” 11.4 Understanding the various billing costs Costs in AnVIL fall into one of three categories: compute costs, storage costs, and network usage (egress) costs. Compute costs are those that students accrue when actively using an AnVIL Workspace. Students can clone a Workspace for no cost, but they will begin to accrue costs as soon as they set up a cloud environment. Compute costs are based on how many CPUs you need, as well as how much memory and storage space you choose. You can also pause the Workspace and pay a lower cost per hour than if you were to keep the Workspace running. Current prices can be found here. Storage costs are driven by the persistent disk. The persistent disk allows you to store data and installed programs/libraries for a low cost. Students can delete their Workspaces but maintain their persistent disk so they still have access to previous programs they have installed and previous files they’ve created. Current prices can be found here. Finally, network usage costs are those involved with transferring data between networks or downloading data from the cloud to your local computer. Current prices can be found here. 11.5 Estimating costs before the class begins AnVIL has a free AnVIL_Cost_Estimator that allows you estimate compute, storage, and network usage costs for your class. This is a Google sheet that you can tailor to fit your needs. Before you use it, make sure the prices are up to date by following the links at the bottom of the sheet. If you need to create a Budget Justification for your class, you can also use the free AnVIL_Budget_Justification template. 11.6 How much does a class cost? One of the advantages of billing projects in Terra is that you can keep track of the costs during real time. You can see how much each Workspace is costing while your course is happening, so there are no unexpected surprises at the end! Full details about billing in Terra can be found here. These instructions are adapted from Terra Support. To view the costs being accrued by each billing project, you can go to https://console.cloud.google.com/billing. At the top of the page, there is a dropdown menu. Choose the billing project name you’d like to view. Once you are in proper billing project, you click on “View detailed charges” in the Billing section on the far right. This takes you to a report of the detailed charges accrued by the billing account. Here, you will be able to see the total cost over a time range, as well as costs broken down by services.

You will need to have a list of who will be taking your class, such as a course roster or sign-up list, as well as a list of additional instructors or teaching assistants. You can make changes later, so the list of students need not be final. 12.2 Collect Google IDs AnVIL IDs are based on Google accounts. Students – Contact students/participants to get their AnVIL IDs. These should be Gmail addresses or emails with GSuite capabilities. You can link students to Student Account Setup for instructions on what they should do. Co-instructors – If you will be working with other instructors, such as co-instructors or teaching assistants, you will need to collect their IDs as well. 12.3 Set Up Groups Reminder: Google Billing Accounts are managed on Google Cloud Platform and are used for organizing funding sources (e.g. credit cards, cloud credits). Terra Billing Projects are managed through Terra, and allow you to associate your Terra activity with the correct Google Billing Account. For a more detailed explanation, please see the chapter on Account Setup. We suggest creating two different Terra Billing Projects under the appropriate Billing Account that you created on cloud.google.com: one for students and one for co-instructors. The instructions below will walk you through how to set this up. Groups enable you to share your class Workspace and manage permissions for many people at once. We recommend starting with one Group for instructors and one Group for students. Instructor Group {#instructor-group} Create an informative, unique Group name for any co-instructors and teaching assistants. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your instructor Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique instructor Group. Add Instructors as “Admin” (Instructor Group) Now that your instructor Group has been created, you should add any additional instructors. You should also ensure that they have the correct permissions. Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the instructor Group name. This page should also be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. Student Group {#student-group} Next, you will create a Group for your students. Create an informative, unique Group name. We suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students”). Only letters, numbers, underscores, and dashes are allowed in Group names. To create a Group for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups Click “+ Create a New Group” Type in your student Group name Click “CREATE GROUP” You now have a unique student Group. Add Instructors as “Admin” (Student Group) The next steps ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Group in case you are unavailable. Follow the steps below to add each co-instructor in the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add the instructor’s AnVIL ID. Type in the instructor’s AnVIL ID Make sure “Can manage users (admin)” is selected Click ADD USER. This will take you back to the Group administration page. Make sure the newly added instructor displays “Admin” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. Repeat this process for any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants. Add Students as “Member” Follow the steps below to add individual students to the student Group: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/ and click on the student Group name. This page should be visible at https://anvil.terra.bio/#groups/&lt;group-name&gt;. Click on “+Add User”. You will be prompted to add an AnVIL ID. Type in the student’s AnVIL ID Click ADD USER Make sure the newly added student displays “Member” under “Roles” beside their AnVIL ID. At present, each student’s AnVIL ID must be added separately. Your instructor and student Groups are now set up. Group Email Lists Note that your newly created Groups have Group emails associated with them. Take note of these Group emails. You will use them for granting access to your class Billing Projects and Workspaces in the next steps. 12.4 Set Up Billing Projects Billing Projects in Terra help organize your compute costs. Like Groups, we suggest creating two different billing projects under the appropriate Billing Account that you created on cloud.google.com: one for students and one for co-instructors. Billing Project names must be globally unique and cannot exceed 30 characters. Instructor Billing Project {#instructor-billing-project} First, create the Billing Project for instructors. We suggest the name of the Billing Project should be a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-instructors-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project for instructors: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your instructor Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique instructor Billing Project. Add Instructors as “Owner” (Instructor Project) Next, you want to give instructors permission to use the Billing Project to compute. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for instructors in Instructor Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in Instructor Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” Your instructor Billing Project is now set up. Student Billing Project {#student-billing-project} Next, create a student Billing Project. Again, we suggest a combination of institution-class-role (e.g., “jhu-bmr2021-students-bill-1”). To create a Billing Project for students: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Click “+CREATE” Type in your student Billing Project name Select the appropriate Billing Account (same as above) Click “CREATE BILLING PROJECT” You now have a unique student Billing Project. Add Instructors as “Owner” (Student Project) You want to ensure any additional co-instructors and teaching assistants are able to administer the student Billing Project in case you are unavailable. To set instructor permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for students in Student Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the instructor Group name set up in [### Set Up Groups]. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors@firecloud.org). Ensure “Can manage users (Owner)” is selected Click “ADD USER” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit permissions and administer the student Billing Project as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the student Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should always use the instructor Billing Project to compute. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with instructors versus students. Add Students as “User” Next, you will add your student Group to the student Billing Project so that they can compute. To set student permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#billing Select the “Owned by You” Billing Project sub-list Select the Billing Project you made for students in Student Billing Project Select the “Users” tab Click “+ Add User”. You will be prompted to add a “User email *”. Begin typing the student Group name set up in Student Group. You should see an email in the form (firecloud.org?) (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-students@firecloud.org). Keep “Can manage users (Owner)” deselected. Click “ADD USER” Your student Billing Project is now set up. 12.5 Set Permissions on the Workspace Finally, you will want to set up permissions for co-instructors and students to see the class Workspace you created with the development Billing Project in Developing Content. AnVIL users can take on the “Owner”, “Writer”, or “Reader” role for a Workspace. Add Instructors as “Owner” You should add your co-instructors and teaching assistants as “Owners” to the class Workspace. This is useful if they need to edit the course content or share the space with students on your behalf. To share and change permissions: Go to https://anvil.terra.bio/#workspaces and find your class Workspace you set up in Developing Content Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the instructor Group (e.g., jhu-bmr2021-instructors). This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Change permissions to “Owner” using the dropdown menu under the instructor Group Click “SAVE” This step makes it so that co-instructors can edit the original content of the Workspace as needed. While this means you and co-instructors can compute using the development Billing Project, this makes spending difficult to track. Instructors should instead clone the Workspace using the instructor Billing Project. This makes it much easier to track costs associated with this iteration of your class versus further iterations (e.g., the following semester or year). Add Students as “Reader” Next, add your students as “Readers” to the class Workspace. This means they will be able to view and clone the Workspace, but not make edits or perform computations. To share the Workspace: Click the teardrop button for your class Workspace Click “Share”. This will open a dialog box. Enter the name of the student Group. This will create a dropdown for the Group permissions in the box. Select this Group. Ensure permissions are set to “Reader” (default) Click “SAVE” You have now correctly set up your class permissions! 12.6 Notify Terra Contacting Terra ahead of your class time helps the Terra team avoid any major disruptions to your class. Contact Terra by submitting a request for a hold on scheduled maintenance and downtime. It’s also a good idea to ask about major changes planned for the time prior to your class.
